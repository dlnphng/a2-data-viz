    <h1>Australia's Mineral Wealth: An Exploration of the Mining Industry</h1>
    <p>Over the past decade, Australia has solidified its place as a global leader in the mining industry. 
        This data journey explores its role, from dominating global exports to the regional distribution of its mineral wealth, 
        and the impact of external factors.</p>
    
    <div id="map">
        <h2>Australia: A Global Leader in Mining Exports</h2>
        <p>The story begins with a global snapshot of the top exporters and importers of ores and metals.
             Australia shines as one of the largest exporters, contributing a significant percentage to the world’s total exports.</p>

    </div>


    <h2>The Rise and Recovery of Australia’s Mineral Wealth</h2>
    <p>Zooming in on Australia, the focus shifts to its internal mineral deposits. 
        Western Australia (WA) leads as the most resource-rich region, consistently contributing the largest share of deposits. </p>
    <div id="styling" ></div>
    <!-- <p>Use the dropdown to view contributions by individual states</p> -->
    <p>2010-2016 saw a decline in demand, leading to a drop in total deposits. Thanks to efforts in improving efficiency, the industry bounced back, with deposits rising steadily from 2016 onward</p>

    <h2>Influence on Exchange Rate</h2>
    <p>Australia’s mining exports don’t just affect trade—they also have a direct impact on the country’s exchange rates. 
        When export volumes rise, the increased supply of Australian dollars in global markets puts downward pressure on the currency, resulting in a lower exchange rate. 
        Conversely, when export volumes decrease, the demand for Australian dollars increases, strengthening the exchange rate. 
        This chart shows how fluctuations in export volume closely influence currency value, demonstrating the economic ripple effect of mining exports.</p>

    <h2>The Impact of Mining on Australia’s Energy Consumption</h2>
    <p>Australia’s mining sector doesn’t just affect Exchange Rate—it’s also one of the largest consumers of energy. 
        This pie chart shows the distribution of energy consumption across industries, with mining standing out as a significant user. </p>
    <!-- <div id="energy"></div> -->

    <p>Australia’s mining sector has maintained its stronghold on the global stage, while its exports continue to play a key role in shaping the country's economic landscape. 
        By driving exports, strengthening regional contributions, and influencing favorable exchange rates, Australia remains a crucial player in global mining and economic stability.</p>
